Hello! That's me in the picture. That's also my eye.
I'm a computer engineer, so in proper engineering style, the key facts in a bulleted list:
<ul>
  <li>I'm working on my B.S. in Computer Engineering at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. </li>
  <li>A hyperboleon is a unit of hyperbole. It's pronounced high-<em>per</em>-bowl-on,
    but really quickly. This domain was purchased in high school.</li>
  <li>I like to code and to cycle. In my spare time I watch movies and draw.</li>
</ul>
