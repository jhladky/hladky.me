<p>When I'm not clawing my way out from under a mountain of homework, I'm working on personal projects, either on my own, or with the Cal Poly IEEE Student Branch.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bayridge.hyperboleon.net/hyperboleon/prj_live/RedditFlow.html"><b>Reddit Flow</b></a> -- This was my final project for the summer course I took in javascript</li>
  <li><a href="http://calpolyieee.org/projects/led_matrix"><b>LED Cube</b></a> -- The objective is to construct a cube composed of more than 3000 bi-color LEDs, controlled by an AVR processor and capable of taking input from various sensors. I am working on the software side of the project, writing the LED display and cube control code.</li>
  <li><a href=""><b>Cal Poly IEEE Website</b></a> -- I am currently working on the frontend of the calpolyieee.org website.</li>
  <li><a href=""><b>This Website</b></a> -- With the execption of <em>normalize.css</em>, all styling, content, html, etc. on this website was created and designed by me.</li>
</ul>
