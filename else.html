<p>I'm involved in the local <a href="http://ieee.calpoly.edu">IEEE Student Branch</a> on campus.</p>
Cool Classes I've taken/am taking:
<ul>
  <li><b>CPE233 - Computer Design and Assembly Language Programming</b><br>
    VHDL and CPU architecture. Heavy on the VHDL, light on letting you sleep or do anything other than program for the class.</li>
  <li><b>CPE357 - Systems Programming</b><br>
    Low level C. In this class I discovered I really loved to program. I also discovered that sometimes, 10am is too early for class.</li>
  <li><b>CPE365 - Introduction to Database Systems (Currently Enrolled)</b><br></li>
  <li><b>CPE453 - Introduction to Operating Systems</b><br>
    Even lower level C. Writing a thread library means using assembly to move the stack pointer about, which more or less breaks printf-style debugging... This was a <b>hard</b>, but very interesting class.</li>
  <li><b>CPE464 - Introduction to Networks (Currently Enrolled)</b><br></li>
  <li><b>EE306/307 - Semiconductor Device Electronics</b><br>
    Transistors: no longer powered by magic. Now it's all about the electrons... i.e. magic.</li>
  <li><b>CS490 - Javascript and Web Applications (Summer Course)</b><br></li>
  <li><b>CPE315 & CSC 520 - Introduction/Advanced Computer Architecture (Currently Enrolled)</b></li>
</ul>

Languages I know:
<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>VHDL</li>
  <li>JS/HTML/CSS</li>
</ul>
I'm also familiar with powershell, owing to some use over the summer, and bits and pieces of python I pick up when I need to. On the complete other end of the spectrum, I'm familiar with some of the assembly languages, specifically having used MIPS. I'd like to learn scheme or some variant, and possibly something weird and old like Pascal, hopefully an upcoming academic break will provide the opportunity. A quick plug: For what it's worth, I really enjoy javascript now, thanks to <em>Javascript: The Good Parts</em>, by Douglas Crockford.
