<p>I'm involved in the local <a href="http://ieee.calpoly.edu">IEEE Student Branch</a> on campus.</p>
          Cool Classes I've taken/am taking:
            <ul>
              <li><b>CPE233 - Computer Design and Assembly Language Programming</b><br>
                VHDL and CPU architecture. Heavy on the VHDL, light on letting you sleep or do anything other than program for the class.</li>
              <li><b>CPE357 - Systems Programming</b><br>
                Low level C. In this class I discovered I really loved to program. I also discovered that sometimes, 10am is too early for class.</li>
              <li><b>CPE365 - Introduction to Database Systems</b><br></li>
              <li><b>CPE453 - Introduction to Operating Systems</b><br>
                Even lower level C. It turns out that mucking with the stack pointer can break printf statements sometimes.Not the worst debugging experience of my life... definitely in the top 5 though.</li>
              <li><b>CPE464 - Introduction to Networks</b><br></li>
              <li><b>EE306/307 - Semiconductor Device Electronics</b><br>
                Transistors: no longer powered by magic. Now it's all about the electrons... i.e. magic.</li>
              <li><b>CS490 - Javascript and Web Applications (Summer Course)</b><br>
                Learning a dynamic, weakly typed language was a bit of a culture shock, to say the least.
                Segfaults are terrible, but at least you know something's wrong.</li>
              <li><b>CPE315 & CSC 520 - Introduction/Advanced Computer Architecture</b></li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            Languages I know:
            <ul>
              <li>C</li>
              <li>Java</li>
              <li>VHDL</li>
              <li>JS/HTML/CSS</li>
            </ul>
            I really enjoy javascript, thanks to <em>Javascript: The Good Parts</em>, by Douglas Crockford. I spend most of my time coding in C, thanks to the sheer volume of schoolwork I have that requires it, and I do love C. But I also love first-class functions, and javascript's ridiculous typing system. Recently I found myself writing some Java where my function did not just run over 80 characters, it ran over several multiples of 80! After trauma like that, being able to declare a function like:
<code>var foo = function(bar, baz) {}</code>
is liberating. I'm interested in other (very-)high level languages like lisp/scheme and parts of python.
